jBASE-SQL-Server-ETL
====================

Blazing Fast Data Extraction from jBASE to SQL Server

The jBASE-SQL Server ETL is a suite of utilities that work together to extract and load data from jBASE to SQL Server securely. 

Network communications are done through secured channels such as SSH2 and SSPI. File encryption and decryption are done in the application runtime and data is never written to disk in plain text. 

The ETL not only gets the data securely from jBASE to SQL Server but it's also fast, really fast.
